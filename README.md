# Recon Bolt

###### A tiny SwiftUI app to let you view your underlying competitive rating changes.

Based on [RumbleMike/ValorantStreamOverlay](https://github.com/RumbleMike/ValorantStreamOverlay), using their assets (for ranks & maps) and interaction strategy for Valorant's Client API.

Unfortunately, this app needs your Riot username and password to function, but of course you can view the code yourself to check its safety, and the password is stored in the keychain rather than as plaintext.

## TestFlight

I've uploaded a build of the app to Apple and they approved it for beta testing! [Here's the link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/M1e2dgxj) to join the beta :)
