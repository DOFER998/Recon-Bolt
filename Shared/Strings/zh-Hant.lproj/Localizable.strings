Recon Bolt started development in early 2021, back when it wasn't yet possible to see your RR gains and losses in the game, but the API offered those numbers. I made an app to see the numbers and better understand my rank changes.

As you can guess, the scope expanded massively over time to what you're using now. I hope you're enjoying it!

If you've encountered a bug or have some feedback, I'm always happy to hear it on the Discord Server or GitHub :)" = "嗨！ 我是Julian Dunskus，我做了這個應用程式。

Recon Bolt於2021年當初開始開發，當時還無法在遊戲中看到您的RR上升和下跌，但API提供了這些數字。 我製作了一個應用程式來檢視數字並更好地瞭解我的排名變化。

正如您可以猜測的那樣，隨著時間的推移，範圍會大大擴充套件到您現在使用的內容。 我希望你喜歡它！

如果您遇到錯誤或有一些反饋，我總是很高興在Discord伺服器或GitHub上聽到它:)";
